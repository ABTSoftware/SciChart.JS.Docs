## TypeDoc links

In order to make all TypeDoc links distinct I would suggest to use a book icon `:blue_book:`, this is an example of SciChartSurface class typedoc link

[SciChartSurface:blue_book:](https://www.scichart.com/documentation/js/v4/typedoc/classes/scichartsurface.html)

## Marking document status

Use this symbols to mark the status of menu items

‚≠ï - new documentation to write

‚ö†Ô∏è - existing doc to update

üîÑ - in progress

‚úÖ - done

# Naming convention

1. It is recommended to **create a separate folder for each document** and to put README.md file inside. Having a separate folder is preferable because often documentation contains doc-snippets and it is nice to have them in the same folder.
2. In order to have nice URLs it is recommended to create folder names in a **kebab-case notation** like `my-folder-name`.
