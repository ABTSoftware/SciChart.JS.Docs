# âœ… Polar Axis Styling

Polar axes in SciChart.js are specialized axes designed for polar charts, which are circular in nature. They can be used to create various types of polar charts, such as radial bar charts, polar line charts, and more. 

There are currently only 2 types of polar axes available: [PolarNumericAxis:blue_book:](https://www.scichart.com/documentation/js/v4/typedoc/classes/polarnumericaxis.html) and [PolarCategoryAxis:blue_book:](https://www.scichart.com/documentation/js/v4/typedoc/classes/polarcategoryaxis.html), which are used for numeric and categorical data, respectively. Most properties of these two are the same, with some differences in the way they handle data and labels.

## Key Polar Axis Concepts

### Angle Sweep & Start 
> how far the axis sweeps, and where it starts from on the circle, via [totalAngle:blue_book:](https://www.scichart.com/documentation/js/v4/typedoc/classes/polaraxisbase.html#totalangle) and [startAngle:blue_book:](https://www.scichart.com/documentation/js/v4/typedoc/classes/polaraxisbase.html#startangle) properties, having values in the range of `0` to `2 * Math.PI`. 

:::tip
There is also a **degree mode**, with values in between `0` and `360` degrees but used with [totalAngleDegrees:blue_book:](https://www.scichart.com/documentation/js/v4/typedoc/classes/polaraxisbase.html#totalangledegrees) and [startAngleDegrees:blue_book:](https://www.scichart.com/documentation/js/v4/typedoc/classes/polaraxisbase.html#startangledegrees) instead.

### Flipped Coordinates 
> whether the axis increments clockwise or counter-clockwise, via [flippedCoordinates:blue_book:](https://www.scichart.com/documentation/js/v4/typedoc/classes/polaraxisbase.html#flippedcoordinates) property, can be set on any of the axes.
>
> When `flippedCoordinates` is set to `true` on the Angular axis, the [startAngle:blue_book:](https://www.scichart.com/documentation/js/v4/typedoc/classes/polaraxisbase.html#startangle) will be reversed, so `-Math.PI/2` will not make the axis start at 12 o'clock (as it usually does), but rather at 6 o'clock.

### Polar Labels 
> how the labels are displayed, via [polarLabelMode:blue_book:](https://www.scichart.com/documentation/js/v4/typedoc/classes/polaraxisbase.html#polarlabelmode) property.  
> 
> The default value is `polarLabelMode`: [Horizontal:blue_book:](https://www.scichart.com/documentation/js/v4/typedoc/enums/epolarlabelmode.html#horizontal), which means that the labels will be drawn horizontally (never rotating), while the [Perpendicular:blue_book:](https://www.scichart.com/documentation/js/v4/typedoc/enums/epolarlabelmode.html#perpendicular) mode will draw the labels perpendicular to the axis, while the [Parallel:blue_book:](https://www.scichart.com/documentation/js/v4/typedoc/enums/epolarlabelmode.html#parallel) mode will draw them parallel to the axis.

:::tip
There is also the [labelStyle:blue_book:](https://www.scichart.com/documentation/js/v4/typedoc/classes/polaraxisbase.html#labelstyle) property, which acts the same way as the [AxisBase.labelStyle:blue_book:](https://www.scichart.com/documentation/js/v4/typedoc/classes/polaraxisbase.html#labelstyle) property, allowing you to set the font, color, and other styles of the labels based on the [TLabelStyle:blue_book:](https://www.scichart.com/documentation/js/v4/typedoc/index.html#ttextstyle) type.

### Grid mode for Radial Gridlines

> The grid mode for radial gridlines can be controlled via the [gridlineMode:blue_book:](https://www.scichart.com/documentation/js/v4/typedoc/classes/polaraxisbase.html#gridlineMode) property. This property determines how the radial gridlines are drawn.
>
> For a Spider/Radar chart look you can set this property to [EPolarGridLineMode.Polygon:blue_book:](https://www.scichart.com/documentation/js/v4/typedoc/enums/epolargridlinemode.html#polygon), which will draw the gridlines as concentric polygons, or you can stick to the default [EPolarGridLineMode.Circles:blue_book:](https://www.scichart.com/documentation/js/v4/typedoc/enums/epolargridlinemode.html#circles) which draws radial gridlines as arcs.

## Other Styling Properties

### Major Gridlines 
> aligned with labels having [majorGridLineStyle:blue_book:](https://www.scichart.com/documentation/js/v4/typedoc/classes/polaraxisbase.html#majorglstyle) and [drawMajorGridLines:blue_book:](https://www.scichart.com/documentation/js/v4/typedoc/classes/polaraxisbase.html#drawmajorgl) properties.

### Minor Gridlines 
> between labels with [minorGridLineStyle:blue_book:](https://www.scichart.com/documentation/js/v4/typedoc/classes/polaraxisbase.html#minorglstyle) and [drawMinorGridLines:blue_book:](https://www.scichart.com/documentation/js/v4/typedoc/classes/polaraxisbase.html#drawminorgl) properties.

:::tip
Both Major and Minor gridlines **style** objects have the [TGridLineStyle:blue_book:](https://www.scichart.com/documentation/js/v4/typedoc/index.html#tgridlinestyle) type, which allows you to set the `color`, `thickness`, and `strokeDashArray` of the gridlines.

Also, the [drawMajorGridLines:blue_book:](https://www.scichart.com/documentation/js/v4/typedoc/classes/polaraxisbase.html#drawmajorgl) and [drawMinorGridLines:blue_book:](https://www.scichart.com/documentation/js/v4/typedoc/classes/polaraxisbase.html#drawminorgl) properties are `boolean` values that control whether the gridlines are drawn or not.    
:::

### Major Ticks 
> small marks, outside the axis, aligned with labels with [majorTickLineStyle:blue_book:](https://www.scichart.com/documentation/js/v4/typedoc/classes/polaraxisbase.html#majortickstyle) and [drawMajorTicks:blue_book:](https://www.scichart.com/documentation/js/v4/typedoc/classes/polaraxisbase.html#drawmajorticks) properties.

### Minor Ticks 
> small marks, outside the axis, between labels with [minorTickLineStyle:blue_book:](https://www.scichart.com/documentation/js/v4/typedoc/classes/polaraxisbase.html#minortickstyle) and [drawMinorTicks:blue_book:](https://www.scichart.com/documentation/js/v4/typedoc/classes/polaraxisbase.html#drawminorticks) properties.

:::tip
Both Major and Minor ticks **style** objects have the [TTickLineStyle:blue_book:](https://www.scichart.com/documentation/js/v4/typedoc/index.html#tticklinestyle) type, which allows you to set the `color`, `tickSize`, and `strokeThickess` of the ticks.

## Polar Axis Styling Example

Read the code comments carefully

<CodeSnippetBlock labels={["TS"]}>
    ```ts {18,21,25-26,29,49,53,58,59,61,63} showLineNumbers file=./demo.ts start=region_A_start end=region_A_end
    ```
</CodeSnippetBlock>

This results in the following output:

<LiveDocSnippet name="./demo" />
