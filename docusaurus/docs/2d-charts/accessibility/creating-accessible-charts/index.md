# âœ… Creating Accessible Charts

This is a description of available accessibility features which could be provided by the SciChart. Here we tried to demonstrate how to configure the chart using existing APIs to support some of these features.

The list of accessibility features:

1.  [Voice Over](/docs/2d-charts/accessibility/voice-over/index.md)
2.  [Color and Contrast](/docs/2d-charts/accessibility/color-and-contrast/index.md)
3.  [Keyboard Accessibility](/docs/2d-charts/accessibility/keyboard-accessibility/index.md)
