# âœ… Hit-Test API for Polar Uniform Heatmap Renderable Series

The Hit-Test API for [Polar Uniform Heatmap Renderable Series](/docs/2d-charts/chart-types/polar-uniform-heatmap-renderable-series) is NOT supported in SciChart.js v4.0, not because it is not possible, but because we are want feedback from our users on whether this is a feature they would like to see and if it is worth the effort to implement.

If you require hit-testing of Polar Uniform Heatmaps, contact us at [https://www.scichart.com/contact-us/](https://www.scichart.com/contact-us/) to discuss your requirements and maybe speed up the process.
