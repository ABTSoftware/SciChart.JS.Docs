# âœ… Hit-Test API for Polar XY Scatter Series

The IHitTestProvider.hitTest method on [PolarXyScatterRenderableSeries:blue_book:](https://www.scichart.com/documentation/js/v4/typedoc/classes/polarxyscatterrenderableseries.html) tests if the click was within the Scatter series' Point-Marker body and returns a [HitTestInfo:blue_book:](https://www.scichart.com/documentation/js/v4/typedoc/classes/hittestinfo.html) object with the following properties:

### HitTest on 1 particular Polar Scatter Series:

Calling the `hitTest` method on one specific series is very easy and can be done this way:

```ts {4} showLineNumbers
const x = mouseEvent.offsetX * DpiHelper.PIXEL_RATIO;
const y = mouseEvent.offsetY * DpiHelper.PIXEL_RATIO;

const scatterHitTestInfo: HitTestInfo = scatterSeries1.hitTestProvider.hitTest(x, y);
```

The algorithm is as follows:

1. Find the nearest Scatter Point in X direction.
2. Test if the click was within Marker bounds and update [HitTestInfo.isHit:blue_book:](https://www.scichart.com/documentation/js/v4/typedoc/classes/hittestinfo.html#isHit) property.


### Here is how you would implement it on multiple Polar Scatter Series:

> First, you need to add some renderable series you plan to hit-test on:

```ts {2,8,15,21} showLineNumbers file=./Basic/demo.ts start=#region_A_start end=#region_A_end
```

> Now, add an event-listener on the "mousedown" event:

```ts {29,37,43} showLineNumbers file=./Basic/demo.ts start=#region_B_start end=#region_B_end
```

Which results in this following functionality:
