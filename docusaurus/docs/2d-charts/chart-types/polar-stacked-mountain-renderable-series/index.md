# ðŸ”„ The Polar Stacked Mountain Chart Type

The Polar Stacked Mountain Chart Type is created using a [PolarStackedMountainCollection:blue_book:](https://www.scichart.com/documentation/js/v4/typedoc/classes/polarstackedmountaincollection.html) to manage multiple series of [PolarStackedMountainRenderableSeries:blue_book:](https://www.scichart.com/documentation/js/v4/typedoc/classes/polarstackedmountainrenderableseries.html), which represent the individual stacked mountains in the chart.
