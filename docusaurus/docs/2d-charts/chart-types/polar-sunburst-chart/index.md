# ðŸ”„ The Polar Sunburst Chart Type

The Polar Sunburst Chart Type is created using [PolarColumnRenderableSeries:blue_book:](https://www.scichart.com/documentation/js/v4/typedoc/classes/polarcolumnrenderableseries.html) to represent the sunburst segments, which are arranged in a circular, layered layout based on their angular position and radial distance.
