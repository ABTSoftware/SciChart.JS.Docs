# Chart Styling - Style Chart Parts in Code

In addition to our [ThemeManager with light and dark themes](/docs/2d-charts/styling-and-theming/theme-manager-api/index.md), the ability to [create a custom theme](/docs/2d-charts/styling-and-theming/creating-custom-theme/index.md), you can also style chart parts in code.

:::tip
We have an example in our SciChart.js Examples Suite which shows how to do this - the [Styling a JavaScript Chart in Code example](https://demo.scichart.com/javascript-chart-styling-theming-in-code).

_**Above:** the Styling Axis Gridlines, Labels example shows how to style chart-parts in code._

Take a look at the [Styling a JavaScript Chart in Code example](https://demo.scichart.com/javascript-chart-styling-theming-in-code) in our online demo which shows you how to style each individual chart part. The demo has link to source-code showing all the properties.

:::tip
We also have a page that goes into detail on the various chart parts such as [Axis Gridlines, Axis Ticks, Axis Labels that can be styled here](/docs/2d-charts/axis-api/axis-styling/title-labels-gridlines-axis-band-style/index.md) and [styling Axis Borders and Backgrounds here](/docs/2d-charts/axis-api/axis-styling/axis-borders-and-background/index.md).
