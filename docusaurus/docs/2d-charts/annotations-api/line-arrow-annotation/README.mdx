# LineArrowAnnotation

import ChartPreviewWrapper from "@site/src/components/ChartPreviewWrapper"

The [LineArrowAnnotation](https://www.scichart.com/documentation/js/v4/typedoc/classes/linearrowannotation.html) class extends [LineAnnotation](https://www.scichart.com/documentation/js/v4/typedoc/classes/lineannotation.html) and adds an optional arrowhead at each line endpoint. Use it to annotate charts with directional indicators.

The following code will declare 2 [LineArrowAnnotation](https://www.scichart.com/documentation/js/v4/typedoc/classes/linearrowannotation.html)s and add them to the chart.

```ts file=./demo.js start=#region_A_start end=#region_A_end
```

This results in the following output:

<ChartPreviewWrapper />

In the code above:

- We create two instances of [LineArrowAnnotation](https://www.scichart.com/documentation/js/v4/typedoc/classes/linearrowannotation.html) with different arrowhead styles.
- The first annotation has an arrowhead at the end, while the second has 2 arrowheads, 1 at both ends.
- Also, the first annotation's arrowhead will scale with zooming, while the second will not.
- In case you want to use editable annotations using `isEditable: true`, you can use the `dragPoints` property to pass an array of valid drag points. See [EDraggingGripPoint](https://www.scichart.com/documentation/js/v4/typedoc/enums/edragginggrippoint.html) for more details.

### Unique Properties

| Property | Type | Default | Description |
|----------|------|---------|-------------|
| arrowHeadPosition | [EArrowHeadPosition](https://www.scichart.com/documentation/js/v4/typedoc/enums/earrowheadposition.html) | *End* | Where to place the arrowhead(s) -> Start, End, Start&End |
| isArrowHeadScalable | boolean | *false* | Whether to scale the arrowhead size with zooming. |
| arrowStyle | [IArrowStyle](https://www.scichart.com/documentation/js/v4/typedoc/interfaces/iarrowstyle.html) | - | Arrowhead style options. |
| onArrowHeadSizeChanged | [TArrowheadSizeChangedCallback](https://www.scichart.com/documentation/js/v4/typedoc/index.html#tarrowheadsizechangedcallback) | *undefined* | Callback to modify arrowhead size based on angle. |

All other properties are inherited from [LineAnnotation](https://www.scichart.com/documentation/js/v4/typedoc/classes/lineannotation.html) & [AnnotationBase](https://www.scichart.com/documentation/js/v4/typedoc/classes/annotationbase.html) and work as expected.

**Tip**: 
- Use `headDepth: 0` for simple line arrows without filled heads. 
- Set `isArrowHeadScalable: true` for annotations that maintain relative size during zooming.
