We have a walkthrough guide showing how to get started with a Trial License, or apply a purchased license for SciChart.js at [www.scichart.com/licensing-scichart-js](https://www.scichart.com/licensing-scichart-js)

Community License (non-commercial use)
-------------

Starting from version 3.2 SciChart.js starts up with a FREE Community License.  No need to sign up, start a trial, or enter a license key.  This is for non-commercial use, and limited time commercial evaluation.  For all the details on community licensing, including who can use it, features and restrictions, check out the [community licensing page](https://www.scichart.com/community-licensing/).

For full commercial development and deployment, you need to purchase and apply a full license.  Licenses are unique to all SciChart products, so licenses for another products cannot be used for SciChart JavaScript Charts and vice versa.

Activating a Purchased License
------------------------------

If you have purchased licenses to SciChart, full instructions to license can be found on the web at [www.scichart.com/licensing-scichart-js](https://www.scichart.com/licensing-scichart-js)

If your license has been applied correctly, you should be able to run your application on devices and without seeing the "Powered by SciChart" watermark.

Troubleshooting Licensing & Activation
--------------------------------------

If you have trouble with licensing or activation, please contact [SciChart.js Support](https://support.scichart.com/index.php?/Tickets/Submit).
